# Sushi Go Score Counter

### In progress...

Welcome to my personal project, where I am honing my React skills to develop a web application that simplifies score counting for the popular card game Sushi Go by Gamewright. This game, a favorite among my family, requires tracking scores across multiple rounds, traditionally done with pen and paper. In today's tech-savvy world, I thought it would be incredibly convenient to have a digital solution for this task.

As I continue my coding journey, I am thrilled to implement this project in real-time. Currently, the application features a basic counter to handle score tracking. However, the ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily track and manage scores during gameplay, thereby enhancing the overall experience of playing Sushi Go.

Thank you for joining me on ths exciting jorney. I look forward to sharing more updates and improvements as I progress. Stay tuned for a more refined and user-friendly experience that wil make your Sushi Go game nights even more enjoyable!

Warmly,
Hanna
